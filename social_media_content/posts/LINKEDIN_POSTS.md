### Post 7: Founder's Perspective
**Format**: Personal narrative

**Content**:
```
Why I Built Lockbay: A Founder's Story

In 2023, I lost $1,500 to a crypto exit scam.

I was experienced. I did my research. The seller had "good reviews." But within 24 hours of sending payment, they vanished. No recourse. No protection. Just gone.

That loss taught me three things:

1️⃣ Crypto's promise of "trustless transactions" is incomplete
We need trust layers, not elimination of trust entirely.

2️⃣ Traditional escrow doesn't work for crypto
3-7 day settlements? In a market that moves in seconds? Completely disconnected.

3️⃣ The solution must meet users where they are
Building another app nobody downloads won't help. Integration into existing platforms is key.

So I built Lockbay.

A Telegram-integrated escrow platform that:
✅ Settles in 4.5 seconds (not days)
✅ Works where crypto traders already are
✅ Costs less than coffee (transparent fees)
✅ Has prevented $500K+ in potential fraud

The Mission:
Make crypto trading as safe as it is innovative. Because financial freedom shouldn't require risking everything.

6 months in:
📊 10,000+ transactions protected
🌍 44 countries served
⚡ Zero successful scams
🎯 Just getting started
